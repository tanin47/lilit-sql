We cannot do if-else on the value and dictate the SQL structure. Ooh that would have been cool.

But we would have to execute the first SQL, get the result, and execute the second SQL.

OH MY GOD. This would have been a killer feature. Due to scale, this might not be possible though.cccccbcdkhjgjbhhtireclvnhbnjceltgncntkvenlbr
